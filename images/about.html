            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Crina Maria Pascu, and I am a second-year student at the University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, enrolled in the Faculty of Entrepreneurship, Engineering, and Business Management. My primary focus is on web design, and I am continuously enhancing my skills in front-end development, with a particular emphasis on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I am exploring opportunities in back-end development to broaden my expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
                My academic studies provide a strong foundation in programming and engineering-related subjects, including mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Alongside these, I am studying economics, management, and psychosociology, which enrich my understanding of the broader context in which web technologies operate.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about expanding my knowledge into back-end development to become a full-stack developer. This involves learning about server-side technologies and databases to complement my front-end skills and create comprehensive web solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my formal education, I actively work on independent web design projects, applying and improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have also earned a C1 English certificate from the British Council and a digital competences certificate from ANC, which enhance my proficiency in the tech field.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to excel in web development, integrating both front-end and back-end technologies to deliver innovative and effective web solutions.
